## Security Frameworks and Controls  
  
## Definition of Security Frameworks:

Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.  
Provides a structured approach to implementing (and managing) a **Security Lifecycle**.

### Purposes:

- Protecting PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Securing financial information
- Identifying weaknesses in security
- Managing organizational risks
- Aligning security with business goals

## Core Components:

1. **Identifying and documenting** security goals.
> Example: An Organization aligning its goals with LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados), so it asks an Analyst to identify and document areas where the organizations is out of compliance with LGPD
2. **Setting Guidelines** to achieve security goals.
> Example: When implementing guidelines to achieve LGPD compliance, the organization may need to develop new policies for how to handle data requests from individual users.
3. **Implementing strong security processes**
> Example: in GDPR, a security analyst at a social media company helps create steps to make sure the company follows users’ requests about their personal data. This could happen when a user wants to change or delete their profile information.
> Outcome: The security processes ensure these user requests are handled correctly and safely.
4. **Monitoring and Communicating** results
> Example: Monitoring a organization's internal network and reporting a potential security issue that affects LGPD to the manager or person responsible for compliance.  

### Security Lifecycle:

Policies, rules and standards that define how an organization *manages risks, follows established guidelines and meets regulatory laws and compliance*. *Constantly evolving*.  

## Definition of Security Controls

Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
> Example: a company may have a guideline that requires all employees to complete a privacy training to reduce the risk of data breaches. An analyst may use a software tool to automatically assign and track which employees have completed this training.


## Overview

Frameworks allow analysts to work alongside other security team members to **document, implement and use** the policies and procedures created. Directly affects how analysts work and collaborate with others.  
Both frameworks and controls are **vital** for security in all organizations, and ensuring everyone follows rules to maintain low level of risks.
