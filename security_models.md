# Security Models and Designs

## CIA Triad

Stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability

- **Confidentiality**: **RESTRICTS** access. User *permissions/authorization* to access specific *assets* or *data*. Strict controls that define who should or shouldn't access data, to make sure confidential data remains safe. A bank's vault per se.
- **Integrity**: *Correct, authentic and reliable data*. Forms of data protection, like encryption, to prevent data to be corrupted or tampered with.
- **Availability**: **GRANTS** access. Ensures the data is available to who are authorized to access. A bank's backdoors for workers, per se.

### Asset

An item that has value for the organization. Can be Physical or Intangible (as data). Value determined by the cost associated with said asset, for example, sensitive data as bank account. Therefore, requires more security compared to a website that publishes publicly available news on the internet.
